## Hey i'm Laura 💁🏽‍♀️

#### _Who tf is Laura ?_

## Someone a bit too excited and curious about life sometimes. 

- 🏋🏽 A big sportswoman & fitness coach 
- 👩‍🎓 An economics student (@ University) & IT student (@ 42 Lausanne)
- 🤖 Passionate about new technologies (cryptos, AI)
- 🗺️ A big traveler (24 countries) & explorer (currently preparing to cross Spain on foot solo)
- 🥇 Fan of big challenges and pushing myself beyond my limits 

And so many other things that I'll stop here, otherwise you'll think I'm a computer _(or maybe I am? I'll leave the doubt)_. 

### And as if I wasn't bored enough, I decided to start this wonderful adventure of coding.

And I think that if you are here, what you are interested in is to know what I do in code. Well. **Sometimes I don't even know what I'm doing.** I cry when I get segmentation fault and bus error. But I'm always happy to go over it, for sure. Plus my computer is waterproof. 

### I am currently learning code at 42 Lausanne and having fun with small personal projects at home

- At school, I code mainly in ` C ` (and soon in C++)
- I am learning ` javascript ` at home and its famous library too aesthetic ✨ ` three.js ` ✨. Because I think it's fun to create nice websites 
      - And obvisouly ` html & css `
- And less important: I have mandates in marketing, and more particularly in SEO. So I use daily everything that is php, html, txt files, linking and crawling.
