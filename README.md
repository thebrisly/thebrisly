#### _Who is Laura ?_

Someone a bit too excited and curious about life - I love challenging myself and creating A LOT of things :)

--> Currently learning code at 42 Lausanne (C, C++, js, html, docker...) and studying Information System in the University of Lausanne (coding mainly in Python & java)

Don't ask me why I have so many followers â€“ one day I wrote a GitBook about my adventure at 42 (https://42-cursus.gitbook.io/guide), and for some reason, a bunch of people decided that was worth following. I guess watching me suffer was more entertaining than Netflix
