#### _Who is Laura ?_

Someone a bit too excited and curious about life - I love challenging myself and creating A LOT of things :)

--> Used to be a student of 42 Lausanne
--> Currently coding a web app in Java for my master thesis & creating some personal project because I love coding and as an IT consultant I don't code that much :(

PS : Don't ask me why I have so many followers â€“ one day I wrote a GitBook about my adventure at 42 (https://42-cursus.gitbook.io/guide), and for some reason, a bunch of people decided that was worth following. I guess watching me suffer was more entertaining than Netflix
