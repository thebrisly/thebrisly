#### _Who tf is Laura ?_

### Someone a bit too excited and curious about life 

- 🏋🏽 A big sportswoman & fitness coach 
- 👩‍🎓 An information system student (@ University of Lausanne) & programming student (@ 42 Lausanne)
- 🤖 Passionate about new technologies (blockchain, AI)
- 🗺️ A big traveler (24 countries) & explorer (crossed Spain on foot solo)
- 🥇 Fan of big challenges and pushing myself beyond my limits (actually training for a Marathon and a 100km run)

And so many other things that I'll stop here, otherwise you'll think I'm a computer _(or maybe I am? I'll leave the doubt)_. 



### And as if I wasn't bored enough, I decided to start this wonderful adventure of coding.

And I think that if you are here, what you are interested in is to know what I do in code. Well. **Sometimes I don't even know what I'm doing.** I cry when I get segmentation faults and bus errors. But I'm always happy to go over it, for sure. Plus my computer is waterproof.

### I am currently learning code at 42 Lausanne and Information System in the University of Lausanne

- At 42 school, I code mainly in ` C ` (and soon in C++)

     -> [The repo of my school projects](https://github.com/thebrisly/42-Cursus-Piscine)
      
     I'm also writing a complete gitbook with [Simon](https://github.com/Laendrun/). The purpose of this gitbook is to explain our reasoning from A to Z for each of the projects done at school 42. It's a kind of project report. It is open to everyone and aims to help students stuck in a problem.

     -> [42 Complete Guide](https://42-cursus.gitbook.io/guide/)

- In the university I code in `Java` & `Python`

     -> You can check my repos about security(cryptography & other things), data science and machine learning !

- I am learning ` javascript ` at home and its famous library ✨ ` three.js ` ✨. Because I think it's fun to create nice websites 
      - And obvisouly ` html & css `
- And less important: I have mandates in marketing, and more particularly in SEO. So i'm in touch with php, html, txt files, linking and crawling.
